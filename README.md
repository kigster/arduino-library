# Arduino::Library

This gem encapsulates various rules about the [`library.properties`](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5:-Library-specification#library-metadata) file that contains meta-data about Arduino Libraries.

It also provides convenient shortcuts for downloading the Arduino-maintained database of published libraries in JSON format, searching for various libraries, choosing a version, and more.

It also provides validation functionality for the `library.properties` file for your custom libraries you would like to open source.
 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'arduino-library'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install arduino-library

## Usage

Current version only contains Ruby-based API and is meant to be consumed by other projects (in particularly, check out [Arli](https://github.com/kigster/arli) â€” a command-line tool and an Arduino Library Manager and installer). This project is invaluable if you are you using, for example, [arduino-cmake](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake) project to build and upload your Arduino Code.


### Using the top-level module

If you prefer not to have hard-coded dependencies on the `Arduino::Library::*` sub-classes and sub-modules, you can use the top level module, which proxies several shortcut methods.

You can access these methods in two different ways:

  1. As class methods on `Arduino::Library`, for example `Arduino::Library.db_default`
  2. By including the top-level module in your context, and using methods as instance methods in the current context, eg. `#db_default`

Below we'll focus on the second usage, but if you prefer to use the first syntax, it's there and available for you.

```ruby
require 'arduino/library'
include Arduino::Library
```

#### Using `db_from`

This method returns an instance of the `Arduino::Library::Database` from the provided source:

```ruby
db_from('library_index.json').size 
# => 16
db_from('library_index.json.gz').size
# => 16
db_from('http://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/library_index.json.gz').size 
# => 3653
# This required downloading a 400K gzipped file into a temp file, and reading from there.
```

#### Using `db_default`

This method downloads and returns the official Arduino-maintained index of Arduino libraries.

```ruby
db_default.size
# => 3653
```

#### Using `library_from`

This method reads from a source that can be of many formats (see below) and returns an instantiated `Arduino::Library::Model` for this library. You can then get all library attributes via corresponding methods:

```ruby
library_from('spec/fixtures/audio_zero.json').name 
# => 'AudioZero'
library_from('~/Documents/Arduino/Libraries/AudioZero/library.properties').name 
#=> 'AudioZero'
library_from('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulStoffregen/DS1307RTC/master/library.properties').name
#=> 'DS1307RTC'
```

#### Using `find`

Method `find` is, perhaps, some of the most powerful functionality in this gem. It allows constructing very flexible and precise queries, to match any number of library attributes.

The method has the following signature:

```ruby
find(database = db_default, **opts)
```

`opts` is a Hash that you can use to pass attributes with matchers. All matching results are returned as an array of models.

**Examples**

```ruby
results = find(
  name: 'AudioZero',
  author: /konstantin/i,              # regexp supported
  architectures: [ 'avr' ],           # array is matched if it's a subset
  version: proc do |value|            # or a proc for max flexibility
    value.start_with?('1.')
  end
)

results.size 
#=> <whatever number of matches returned>
```

Note that multiple attributes must ALL match for the library to be included in the result set.

### `Arduino::Library::Database`

> Downloading the index of all libraries, and finding a library.

You can load libraries from a local JSON file, or from a remote URL, eg:  

```ruby 
require 'arduino/library'

database = Arduino::Library::Database.from(
  'http://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/library_index.json.gz')
```

or, since the above link happens to be the default location of Arduino-maintained librarie index file, you can use the `default` method instead:

```ruby
database = Arduino::Library::Database.default
```

or, load the list from a local JSON file, that can be optionally gzipped (just like the URL):

```ruby
database = Arduino::Library::Database.from('library_index.json.gz')
```

Once the library is initialized, the following operations are supported:

```ruby
database.find(name: 'AudioZero', version: '1.0.1') do |audio_zero|
  audio_zero.website        #=> http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Audio
  audio_zero.architectures  #=> [ 'samd' ] 
end
```

You can pass any of the attributes to #find, and the value can be a `String` (in which case only equality matches), or a regular expression, eg:

```ruby
database.find(author: "Paul Stoffregen").size #=> 21
database.find(author: /stoffregen/i).size     #=> 33
```

You interate over multiple using either a block:

```ruby
database.find(name: 'AudioZero') do |match|
  puts match.name # => 'AudioZero'
  puts match.version # => will print all versions of the library available
end
```

or, just grab the return value from `#find`, which is always an array.

```ruby
all_versions = database.find(name: 'AudioZero')
# => [ Arduino::Library::Model<name: AudioZero, version: '1.0.1',... >, .. ]
```

### `Arduino::Library::Model` 

> Use this class to operate on a single library.

#### Reading Library from an External Source using `.from`

You can use an intelligent class method `.from` that attempts to auto-detect the type of file or URL you are passing as an argument, and use an appropriate parser for each type. 

For example, to read from a JSON file: 

```ruby
json_file = 'spec/fixtures/audio_zero.json'
model = Arduino::Library::Model.from(json_file)
model.name #=> 'AudioZero'
```

Or to read from the `.properties` file:

```ruby
properties_file = 'spec/fixtures/audio_zero.properties'
model = Arduino::Library::Model.from(properties_file)
model.name #=> 'AudioZero'
```

### Presenters

Presenters are there to convert to and from a particular format.

#### `.properties` Presenter

```ruby
props = Arduino::Library::Presenters::Properties.new(model).present
File.open('/tmp/audio_zero.properties', 'w') do |f|
   f.write(props)
end

# this creates a file in the format:

# name=AudioZero
# version=1.0.1
# etc.
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
